### 👋 About
- Publishing Punjabi news and guides for Patti and nearby regions, with an emphasis on clarity and access.  
- Experimenting with Progressive Web Apps (manifest, service worker) for offline and installable experiences.  
- Exploring Next.js (SSG/SSR) options, Firebase-backed features, and free hosting workflows.

### 🧰 Tech & Tools
- Web: HTML · CSS · JavaScript
- CMS: Netlify CMS (content in repo)
- App: PWA (manifest.json, sw.js)
- Cloud: Firebase (auth/db/storage as needed)
- Deploy: GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel
- Payments/Support: Razorpay (planned)

### 🗺️ What’s built
- A fast, static-first site with a PWA shell for quick reads on low connectivity.  
- Structured content (news, places, guides) designed for mobile-first consumption.  
- Notification and translation guides for readers.

### 🚧 Roadmap
- Migrate PWA routes to Next.js app directory where helpful (SSG for news, ISR for freshness).  
- Add comments/likes, media uploads, and user profiles (Firebase-first approach).  
- Improve Core Web Vitals and add analytics & structured data.

### 🤝 Collaborate
- Open to contributions, feedback, and collaborations around local journalism tech and PWA patterns.  
- Check issues for “good first issue” and “help wanted” labels.
